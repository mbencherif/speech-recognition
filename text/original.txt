pohnae was a dim-witted man but his wife , mohnae , was very smart . it was the time of planting but they did not have any rice to sow . as was usual in cases like this , mohnae asked her husband to go and borrow some from a neighbour . " but only get soft rice " she said , " because it will grow quickly and we can repay the debt sooner " . 
carrying a large jar , pohnae went from house to house in the village asking to borrow rice . but , everyone he spoke to only had the hard species . he continued his quest without luck until he came to his old friend 's house a few kilometers outside the village centre . pohnae 's friend was threshing last season 's crop in preparation for new sowing . 
" what species is that ? " enquired pohnae . 
" soft " replied his friend . 
" may i borrow some ? " asked pohnae . 
" of course " said his friend , " but you will have to help me finish the winnowing so we can fill your jar . " 
with a jar full of soft rice hoisted on his shoulder , pohnae set off for home . on the bridge crossing the stream not far from home , pohnae stumbled , fell and the contents of the jar spilled into the water . he looked in dismay and then he saw that some grains were rising and floating on the surface . quickly he scooped as many as he could , put them into the jar and set off , once again for home . 
" how can you be sure it is the soft species of rice ? " asked mohnae peering suspiciously into the jar . 
" it is the soft rice for sure , " said pohnae and he told her about his accident on the bridge and that he had managed to collect all the grains that floated . " it must be soft , " he said with a knowing grin , " all the hard rice sank ! " 
mohnae looked at her husband in astonishment and , shaking her head , muttered under her breath , " you are probably the silliest man i have ever known . but you have a good heart . " and with that , she set off to find more soft rice for the planting .
